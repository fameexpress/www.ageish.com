# About Ageish.com

**Welcome to Ageish—A Home for the Sandwich Generation**

The Sandwich Generation refers to those of us who find ourselves caring simultaneously for our children and our aging parents. It's a role filled with love, responsibility, unique challenges, and moments of profound joy. But it can also feel overwhelming, isolating, and difficult to navigate.

That's why Ageish.com exists.

Founded by Shikha Chhatpar—a technology entrepreneur who recently entered the Sandwich Generation herself—Ageish was created to provide clarity, resources, and support to people just like you.

As a mother raising her young daughter and simultaneously caring for her aging parents, Shikha deeply understands the complexities and emotional dynamics of this unique life stage. Leveraging her background in technology and entrepreneurship, she decided to build a platform to support and empower others facing similar experiences.

## Our goals for what we want to achieve with Ageish:

- **Comprehensive Resources:** From senior living options and healthcare insights to childcare tips and emotional well-being.
- **Practical Guidance:** Helpful articles and expert advice designed to simplify your life.
- **Community Connection:** A supportive community of people who truly understand your journey.

Together, we're redefining what it means to care—for our children, for our parents, and importantly, for ourselves.

You're not alone in this. Welcome to Ageish.
